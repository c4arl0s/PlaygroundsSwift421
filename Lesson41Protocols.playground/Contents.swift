// A protocol is a set of rules or procedures that define how things are done.

// In programming, a protocol defines the properties or methods that an object must have in order to complete a task.

// You can print String values, Int values, and Bool values with predictable results:

let string = "Hello, world!"
print(string)
 let number = 42
print(number)
 let boolean = false
print(boolean)

// “The Swift standard library defines many protocols that you'll use when building apps.

// 1.- CustomStringConvertible
// Allows you to control how your custom objects are printed to the console.

// 2.- Equatable
// Allows you to define how instances of the same type are equal to each other

// 3.- Comparable
// Allows you to define how instances of the same type are sorted.

// 4.- Codable
// Allows you to easily encode your type's properties as key/value pairs that can then be saved between app launches.
