// Swift provides two special types for working with nonspecific types:
// Any : can represent an instance of any type at all, including function types.
// AnyObject : can represent an instance of any class type.

// Use Any and AnyObject only when you explicitly need the behavior and capabilities they provide. It is always better to be specific about the types you expect to work with in your code.
class MediaItem {
    var name: String
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}
class Movie: MediaItem {
    var director: String
    init(name: String, director: String) {
        self.director = director
        super.init(name: name) // you have to ask about this, september 1st. 2018.
    }
}
class Song: MediaItem {
    var artist: String
    init(name: String, artist: String) {
        self.artist = artist
        super.init(name: name)
    }
}
// Hereâ€™s an example of using Any to work with a mix of different types, including function types and nonclass types. The example creates an array called things, which can store values of type Any:

var things = [Any]()
things.append(0)
things.append(0.0)
things.append(42)
things.append(3.14159)
things.append("hello")
things.append((3.0, 5.0))
things.append(Movie(name: "Ghostbusters", director: "Ivan Reitman")) //
things.append({ (name: String) -> String in "Hello, \(name)" }) // Closure
// lets pass all members of thea array into for statement to check what kind of type are them:
// notice that after case word is doing the casting

for thing in things {
    switch thing {
    case 0 as Int:
        print("zero as an Int")
    case 0 as Double:
        print("zero as a Double")
    case let someInt as Int:
        print("an integer value of \(someInt)")
    case let someDouble as Double where someDouble > 0:
        print("a positive double value of \(someDouble)")
    case is Double:
        print("some other double value that I don't want to print")
    case let someString as String:
        print("a string value of \"\(someString)\"")
    case let (x, y) as (Double, Double):
        print("an (x, y) point at \(x), \(y)")
    case let movie as Movie:
        print("a movie called \(movie.name), dir. \(movie.director)")
    case let stringConverter as (String) -> String:
        print(stringConverter("Michael"))
    default:
        print("something else")
    }
}
